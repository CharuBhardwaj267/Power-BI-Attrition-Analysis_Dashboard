# Power BI HR Analytics Dashboard

## Overview:
This project includes an interactive **HR Analytics Dashboard** built using **Power BI** to track employee attrition, job satisfaction, and other key HR metrics. The dashboard is designed to give HR managers insights into attrition patterns, employee demographics, and satisfaction levels across departments and job roles. 

## Problem:
HR departments often struggle to visualize and analyze employee attrition data across various metrics such as **age group**, **education field**, and **experience**. This dashboard allows HR managers to quickly identify trends and make data-driven decisions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention.

## Solution:
The **Power BI HR Analytics Dashboard** solves the problem by providing:
- **Attrition by Age Group**: Understand which age groups are most affected by attrition.
- **Attrition by Experience**: Visualize how employee experience correlates with retention.
- **Job Satisfaction**: Insights into job satisfaction levels across different job roles.
- **Key Metrics**: Total employees, average salary, attrition percentage, and more.

### Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive visualizations and the dashboard.
- **Excel / CSV files**: For data storage and import into Power BI.

## Features:
- **Total Employees**: A summary of total employees in the organization.
- **Attrition Percentage**: Attrition rate calculated across various departments and job roles.
- **Age Group Attrition**: A breakdown of attrition across different age groups.
- **Job Satisfaction Levels**: Visualize employee job satisfaction per department and job role.
- **Job Role Distribution**: Shows how attrition is distributed among different job roles.

## How to Use:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `HR_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Interact with the dashboard by selecting different departments and viewing insights related to **attrition**, **age**, **experience**, etc.
4. You can use the **filter** options to analyze data for specific job roles or age groups.

## Key Insights:
- **Dine-In Orders** generated the highest revenue (₹87,826).
- **Evening** time had the highest number of orders (15 Orders).
- **Customer Age** had minimal impact on final bill (R² = 0.012).

## Future Improvements:
- Integrate **real-time data** to track live employee metrics.
- Add **predictive analytics** to forecast future attrition based on historical trends.
- Use **machine learning models** to predict job satisfaction and attrition.
